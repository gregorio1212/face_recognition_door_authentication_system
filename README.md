# Face recognition door authentication system

In this project, we have a whole door authentication system using face recognition. To achieve our goal we used many different technologies:
Apache Server, IIS FTP server(Windows), HTML, PHP, CSS, MySQL, Python, Raspberry Pi 3B+, Debian OS, LAN, and Computer Networking.

More information about how the whole system works will be soon available.
